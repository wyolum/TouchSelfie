# TouchSelfie
Open Source Photobooth based on the official Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen

## Instructions
Install PyDrive
`sudo pip install --upgrade PyDrive`
Then follow the tutorial on [Make Magazine](http://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pi-photo-booth/)

## If you have an existing Photobooth
You can keep all your configuration files! Just install `PyDrive` and pull this code into your existing Photobooth folder.

## GoogleDrive Folder Selection
When you get the "Album ID Not Set" dialog you can try to list the albums from the customize pane. This doesn't seem to be 100% reliable at the moment though. As a fallback, open GoogleDrive, go into the album you want to use, and look at the URL. It should look like:
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/S0m3RaNdoMNumb3rsAndLetTers
```
The last part of the URL, in this case `S0m3RaNdoMNumb3rsAndLetTers`, is the Album's ID. Copy and paste it into the customize dialog or in the `AlbumID` field of `openselfie.conf`
